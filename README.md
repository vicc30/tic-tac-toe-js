# TIC TAC TOE JS

Tic Tac Toe game you can play in your browser!

This excercise is part of Odin Project JavaScript Path.

## Odin Project Excercise

1. Set up your project with a HTML, CSS and Javascript files and get the Git repo all set up.
2. You’re going to store the gameboard as an array inside of a Gameboard object, so start there! Your players are also going to be stored in objects… and you’re probably going to want an object to control the flow of the game itself.
- Your main goal here is to have as little global code as possible
3. Set up your HTML and write a JavaScript function that will render the contents of the gameboard array to the webpage
4. Build the functions that allow players to add marks to a specific spot on the board, and then tie it to the DOM, letting players click on the gameboard to place their marker. Don’t forget the logic that keeps players from playing in spots that are already taken!
5. Build the logic that checks for when the game is over! Should check for 3-in-a-row and a tie.
